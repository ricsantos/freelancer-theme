So, you just got spammed a whole lot of emails from Flurry, urging you to upgrade to the latest SDK (Flurry 4.3.2). Well, you can go and download it from <a title="Flurry SDK 4.2.2" href="http://support.flurry.com/index.php?title=Analytics/Overview/4.2.3_Required_Update" target="_blank">dev.flurry.com</a>, unzip, and be greeted with 3 PDF&#8217;s to wade through. Here is the tl;dr

  1. <a title="Download the SDK" href="http://support.flurry.com/index.php?title=Analytics/Overview/4.2.3_Required_Update" target="_blank">Download the SDK</a>
  2. Delete the existing Flurry files in your XCode project (the libs are now named differently)
  3. Copy the files in the Flurry folder to your project
  4. Optional: Copy the files in the FlurryAds folder to your project
  5. Add **Security.framework** to your project (Build Phases > Link Binary With Libraries)
  6. Optional: If using Flurry ads, also add **AdSupport.framework** to your project

That&#8217;s it. You may want to test it ðŸ™‚
